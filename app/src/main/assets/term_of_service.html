    take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your
    data allowance left.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
    still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
    app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
    use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device
    on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

        the We won’t work properly or at all.
    </li>
</ul>

    At some point, we may want to update the app for troubleshooting or app development.. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements
    for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates
    if you want to keep using the app.

    you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
    providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
